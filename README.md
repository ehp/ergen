# ER generator

ER Generator is simple PlantUML ER schema generator for Postgresql database.
It was needed for one complex customer's database but I couldn't find any tool to visualize it.
This is really only 'quick and dirty' tool for single use, definitely not fully polished application.

## Usage

1. Open ERGen class and change configuration
2. Run `./gradlew run`
